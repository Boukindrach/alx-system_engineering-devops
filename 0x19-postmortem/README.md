Postmortem: Solo Developer Airbnb Clone Project Delay

**Issue Summary:**
From May 1 to June 15, 2024, the development of my Airbnb clone project, "StaySpot," experienced significant delays.
Initially planned for completion by May 31, the project overran by 15 days.
This delay affected my planned launch date and postponed beta testing with a small group of friends.
The root cause was a combination of underestimated complexity in implementing the booking system and unexpected challenges with responsive design.

**Timeline:**

May 1 - Project kickoff, began with user authentication and basic listing display.

May 10 - Completed user profiles and property listing creation features.

May 15 - Started work on the booking system, realized it was more complex than anticipated.

May 20 - Struggled with date range selection and conflict checking in bookings.

May 25 - Shifted focus to the UI to make progress, encountered responsive design issues.

May 31 - Missed initial deadline; re-evaluated project scope and timeline.

June 5 - Returned to booking system, implemented basic functionality without conflict checking.

June 10 - Resolved major responsive design issues across devices.

June 13 - Implemented simplified version of booking conflict resolution.

June 15 - Completed MVP features, began internal testing.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**

The delay was primarily caused by two factors:

underestimated complexity of the booking system and unexpected challenges with responsive design.

The booking system required intricate date handling and conflict resolution, which proved more time-consuming than initially thought.

Additionally, ensuring a consistent user experience across various devices was more challenging than anticipated.

The issue was resolved by simplifying the initial booking system implementation, focusing on core functionality first.

I also dedicated focused time to resolve responsive design issues, using a mobile-first approach and then scaling up to larger screens.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**

Improve project planning and feature prioritization.

Enhance my skills in estimating complex features.

Adopt a more structured approach to responsive design from the project's start.

Implement incremental development with regular milestones.

**TODO List:**

Create a detailed project roadmap with clearer milestones for future projects.

Set up a local testing environment with various device simulations for responsive design.

Develop a reusable component library to speed up future UI development.

Implement automated tests for critical features like the booking system.

Create a study plan to deepen my understanding of complex JavaScript date manipulations.

Set up a staging environment for easier testing and demo purposes.

Develop a basic project template with responsive design basics for future projects.

Schedule regular self-review sessions to catch and address issues earlier.

Create documentation for the booking system logic for easier future upgrades.

Plan for a post-project code refactoring session to improve overall code quality.
